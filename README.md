This repository is part of my internship tasks at ProdigyInfotech, It is a Network packet analyser that I created using Java programming language.
The packet analyzer receives network packets through a specified port and then the network packets are analyzed and certain information on them is displayed to the user.

The program is open for improvement from anyone interested.
